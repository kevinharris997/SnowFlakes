To compile and run the SnowFlakes app, please unzip "libpng.zip" to the "sources" directory located in the root of the Android NDK.

For example, on my machine I unzipped to here:

/Users/kharris/Android/android-ndk-r8e/sources

Result:

/Users/kharris/Android/android-ndk-r8e/sources/libpng
