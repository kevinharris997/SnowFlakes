SnowFlakes
==========

iOS Version - Snow Flakes rendered using OpenGL ES 1.1 via point sprites stored in VBOs.

Android Version - Snow Flakes rendered using OpenGL ES 2.0 via point sprites stored in VBOs.

Please Note: To build the Android version, you'll need both the 
Android SDK and NDK since the app is written in C++ using NativeActivity.
You will also need to unzip the provided "libpng" lib to the sources directory
of the NDK.
